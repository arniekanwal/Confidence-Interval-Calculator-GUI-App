# Confidence-Interval-Calculator-GUI-App #
This is a Comparison of Means Confidence Calculator built into a simple GUI App with Python, Tkinter, and Scipy. 

This calculator can handle the comparison of means or proportions with the following four cases:
 1. Repeated Measures / Paired Test (not independent)
 2. Two Independent Groups with Population Variance Known (or proportions)
 3. Two Independent Groups with Population Variance Unknown
 4. Pooled Test (Population Variance Unknown but Assumed Equal)
 
After selecting the following case for computing the confidence interval, the calculator will allow you to input
your data then displays relevant statistics, along with a normal graph that visualizes the interval you computed.
